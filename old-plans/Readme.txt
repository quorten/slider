This is an OLD README file kept only for your interest.  Do not take
it seriously!  In fact, this README is so old that in fact this is not
really from Sound Studio 0.1 but from an older version that was so old
it wasn't really versioned correctly.  Maybe it should have been
version -0.1.  This file was written after I have learned extensively
about the GNU Project and have been using some GNU tools, but before I
started using Glade, Autoconf, and Automake that have automatically
brought me in to writing software in the form of Free Software
packages very quickly.  I think that this is a nice comparison of how
Free Software education AND experience can really make a difference.

Terms and Conditions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not all of the terms and conditions are stated here. Instead, some are implied because it would be too hard to write out every statement which applies to every case. Just use your common sense and make sure you only do rational things with the program. The following stated terms and conditions are just present to make sure you get a good idea about correct ussage of this program. There are no official licensing conditions on this program.

This program is provided in hopes that it will be useful and for purposes of quality evaluation. It therefore has not warranty.

This program should not cause any damage to any of your property or your body if you use it the right way. Any damage caused will most likely be your fault and I, the creator of this program, will hold no liability.

In conclusion, just be kind and rational. Nobody really likes dealing with legal issues anyways (hopefully).


About Sound Studio 0.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program was originally written for the purpose of filling in features which another program did not have. It therefore is not a complete sound system. However, its purpose is to familiarize yourself with sounds and their specific composition. Once you are familiar with such qualities of sound which very over very small time periods, you should be able to apply your knowledge with a better program to create sound effects which are correct with what you would imagine.

The current version only supports combining sound segments expressed as sine waves by arithmetic addition, editing of sound segments and the total composition, and the ability to see the plots and hear the audio of the sounds you are editing in realtime.

Version 0.2, if it ever proves to need to be built, will contain the following features:
	*Channel-independent amplitude change and time offset
	*Time-dependent amplitude change by two editing paradigms:
		Recording amplitude change from user interface controls
		Editing the amplitude-time plot
	*Time-dependent frequency change of same paradigms
	*Sound analysis tools

However, it is assumed that experimenting with this program is good enough for the goal of this program to be met. However, if this program should prove the need to be used as a complete sound synthesis system, rather than continuing development as a standalone program, it is planned that it will be incorporated into Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), an open source digital audio editing system. Obviously, only the features which Audacity does not have will be incorporated.


Notes about the user interface
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The user interface should be pretty straightforward.


Tips on composition of sounds
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is what this program was created in the first place to figure out. Pretty much everything in the shape of a sound is important. Alost any variation you can think of will drastically change your reconition of a sound. Most of the sound information you use to classify sounds by timbre is all the variances which happen in about 1/100 of a second. Sound variations which happen across 1/10 of a second are more often recognized just how they are in terms of what exactly is being varied. Often times there are a lot of changes which are hard to track that happen in the 1/100 second time period. Since the time-variant features are not in this version of the program, you will have to use another program to test small scale time-variant details.
