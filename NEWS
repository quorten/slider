* Slider 0.1.4
  Only minor bug fixes at the source code level.

* Slider 0.1.3
  Audio playback added.  Binary relocation support added, for both
  Linux-based systems and FreeBSD.  Name changed.  User interface
  improved.  Tested on a Debian system.  Added specific support for
  JACK.  Basically, improvements were added all around, though there's
  still more to be wished for.

* Sound Studio 0.1.2
  Initial version released.  Notable missing features are direct
  in-application support for playback and "1st Harmonic Drop" is not
  implemented.  However, an additional Easter Egg feature for
  exporting waveforms is implemented as a workaround for the playback
  deficiency.

* Sound Studio 0.1
  Initial version created.
