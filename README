Slider is an interactive program designed to help you synthesize sound
effects by building them from harmonics and by combining multiple
non-harmonic sine waves.

For instructions on how to build Slider, see the file named INSTALL.
The usual "./configure; make; make install" process should work for
most systems.

The file AUTHORS contains a list of code contributors to this project.
For the list of translators, see the file TRANSLATORS.  Additional
contributors of ideas and smaller changes are listed in the file
THANKS.

For a list of user visible changes, see the file NEWS.  "ChangeLog"
contains a list of source code changes.  "COPYING" contains Slider's
license: the Simplified BSD License.

"autogen.sh" is used to generate files related to the build system.
"aclocal.m4" is used by "configure" as a local list of macros used
from other macro packages.  "config.h.in" is processed by "configure"
to create a configuration header when building the project.
"configure.ac" is the Autoconf source file that "configure" is
generated from.

"Makefile.am" is the Automake source file used to generate
"Makefile.in".  "Makefile.in" is processed by "configure" to create
the project makefile.

"design.glade" and "design.gladep" are the Glade project files that
were used to generate some of the source code.  These files are
heavily out of date with the current code base.
