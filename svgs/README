This directory contains the Inkscape SVG image sources that was used
to create any related pixmaps that this program uses.

The Windows icon is generated with the help of icotool, which is part
of icoutils <http://www.nongnu.org/icoutils>.  To generate the Windows
icon, first use Inkscape (or another suitable program) to export the
PNG images from app.svg (if you modified the file) in sizes 16x16,
32x32, 48x48, and 256x256, then use icotool to combine them into the
icon file.  Make sure you explicity instruct icotool to embed all the
16x16 and 32x32 icons of the same color depth (any maybe the other two
also), otherwise you might run into problems.  If you are going to add
the 256x256 image, you probably want to embed the PNG image raw.

If you are using an old version of the Windows Platform SDK resource
compiler, you will not be able to compile an icon containing a raw PNG
image into your binary.  For such resource compilers, an icon named
"app_legacy.ico" is provided that does not have a 256x256 image in the
icon.  This does not concern those who use "windres" from MinGW to
compile the resources into their binary.
