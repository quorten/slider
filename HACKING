Unfortunately, I do not have many provisions on this project for
collaboration with other programmers right now.  However, I do respect
all good efforts to improve the program and if possible, I will make
arrangements for changes to get incorporated into the main source
code.

Ideally, you will send a patch of your changes, through some sort of
contact, preferably the one which you got this program through.

Here are some interesting readings if you want to increase your
chances of patch acceptance, and improve your hacker skills in
general:
