/**
 * @mainpage Sound Studio Architecture
 *
 * Sound Studio's source code makes a central distinction between two
 * different facilities: the user interface and the internal data
 * model.  The following information contains some discussion on each
 * of those topics.
 *
 * @section uiexpl_sec The User Interface
 * Since this program was primarily intended to be interactive, the
 * existence of the user interface is practically the most important
 * part of the program.  In fact, the only reason for the existence of
 * the data model back-end was so that this program could be made
 * useful, of course: so that you could export your data to other
 * <i>real</i> audio programs.
 *
 * The program's user interface makes extensive use of a widget
 * combination called a scientific notation editor.  Ideally, this
 * should be implemented as a GTK+ widget class, but right now, the
 * source code implements each part of the ideal widget as a separate
 * widget.
 *
 * This paragraph is additional commentary, which you may skip.  One
 * feature of this program's user interface that makes it unusual and
 * probably un-user-friendly is its utilization of widgets that are
 * dynamically created and destroyed in an unconventional way.  This
 * unconventional widget policy also leads to slightly less
 * conventional practices regarding the programming of its user
 * interface.  Originally, the idea of this program's user interface
 * was drawn out in Inkscape, then later created within Glade.  The
 * Glade source files are included within this source distribution.
 * The conventional editing facilities of Glade made it not very
 * suitable to store the user interface from within an XML file then
 * load that data from the file.  So instead, a slightly older version
 * of Glade was used which had the feature of being able to generate C
 * code that builds the user interface.  This code was then modified
 * as necessary.  Because of the modifications, you should not try to
 * regenerate the code from the Glade project file unless you know
 * what you are doing.
 *
 * The editing area contains one window that is used to edit the
 * fundamental frequency, and a series of one or more other windows
 * that can be used to edit harmonics.  Both such types of windows are
 * generated from a single function, create_wvedit_holder(), and the
 * parameter @a first_type specifies if a fundamental editor should be
 * returned.
 *
 * On the top of the main window is a combo box that is used to select
 * the current fundamental frequency being edited.  When a different
 * fundamental frequency is selected, all of the windows currently in
 * the editing area are destroyed and new windows corresponding to the
 * selected fundamental set are created.  Data is stored within the
 * program's data model to save the state of the previous editor
 * windows.
 *
 * Moving on from here, you should be able to look at the source code
 * in interface.c, interface.h, and wv_editors.h for the
 * implementation of the user interface.
 *
 * The following functions from wv_editors.c are relevant to the user
 * interface: free_slider_data(), add_wv_editor(), remove_wv_editor(),
 * restore_prec_sliders(), select_fund_freq(), unselect_fund_freq().
 *
 * @section datamod_sec The Data Model
 * The program has one global variable which stores all information
 * related to the waveform data within the program: ::wv_all_freqs.
 * This is implemented as a wrapper type to a GArray.
 *
 * The reason why wrapper types are used in this program is to
 * replace ugly syntax such as this:
 *
@verbatim
cur_fund = &g_array_index (wv_all_freqs, Wv_Fund_Freq, i);
cur_harmonic = &g_array_index (cur_fund->harmonics, Wv_Data, j);
cur_harmonic->harmc_num;
@endverbatim
 *
 * with that:
 *
@verbatim
wv_all_freqs->d[i].harmonics->d[j].harmc_num;
@endverbatim
 *
 * Since the program can have only one fundamental frequency selected
 * at a time, there is another global variable which stores the index
 * of the currently selected fundamental set, ::g_fund_set.
 * Fundamental frequencies inside of the C code are always counted as
 * zero-based indices, even though the user interface displays the
 * numbers starting from one.
 *
 * Many of the functions take a parameter to specify which fundamental
 * frequency they should work with.  For the functions that have this
 * behavior, it should be preserved, because it allows such functions
 * to work with a fundamental frequency other than the one which is
 * selected.  This is important for file loading.
 *
 * Moving on from here, you should be able to look at the source code
 * in the rest of this program.  I hope you found this document
 * useful.
