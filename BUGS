Bugs in Sound Studio
********************

* The code that loads a Sound Studio project file is not robust enough
  to handle errors in the input.

* The precision sliders in the user interface can be jumpy and
  imprecise.

* The fractional position of the window divider in the user interface
  is not consistent under resizes.

* Moving the application's main window causes the window divider
  position to be recalculated and everything in the window to be
  redrawn.
