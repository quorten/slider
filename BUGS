Bugs in Slider Wave Editor
**************************

* Some of the Spanish translations are atrocious and should be removed
  or replaced.

* GTK+ on Microsoft Windows is slower than WxWidgets on computers that
  don't have high-end graphics.

* PortAudio sound doesn't work with MSVC binaries when the locale is
  anything other than C.

* The user interface uses scrollbars as a replacement for sliders in
  certain contexts, directly violating the GNOME Human Interface
  Guidelines.
