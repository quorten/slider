Slider is an interactive program designed to help you synthesize sound
effects by building them from harmonics and by combining multiple
non-harmonic sine waves.

The primary motivation of this program was to be able to pair
graphical representations of sound waves with the audible
representation, and in the process, learn various mathematical
properties of sounds.

Background Information
**********************

Slider's user interface and workflow are designed around the harmonic
waves model of sound.  In this model, sound is a series of increases
and decreases in air pressure, and when those pressure changes are
graphed, they resemble a series of sine waves which are added
together.  When an object by itself vibrates, it can vibrate with more
than one frequency simultaneously.  However, an object will not
vibrate well to just any frequency because not all waveforms can fit
evenly in the size of an object.  Therefore, vibrating objects tend to
vibrate only in frequencies that are a multiple of a fundamental
frequency, so that such higher frequencies can fit evenly in the size
of the object.

Multiple frequencies which an object is vibrating by are called
harmonics, and the fundamental frequency is also called the first
harmonic.  Therefore, the number by which a harmonic is called is
equal to its multiple of the fundamental frequency.

How To Use
**********

Slider's user interface is mainly divided into two parts: a display
which shows the resulting waveform and a control area.  There is also
an upper toolbar that supplements the control area.

The Display
===========

The display has a time scale set to be small enough just to display
the necessary unique parts of the resulting waveform.  Wait!  How does
the display set the time scale?  Make sure you read this carefully, so
that you do not get fooled when using this audio application.  This is
the algorithm that Slider uses to automatically set the time scale:

* If there is only one unique fundamental frequency (i.e. multiple
  fundamental sets within Slider but all of the same fundamental
  frequency), the time scale will be set to one complete period of the
  fundamental frequency.

* If there is more than one unique fundamental frequency, the time
  scale will be set to show the complete interference pattern between
  the waves.  When more than two unique fundamental frequencies are
  involved, the complete interference pattern is contained within the
  interference pattern length of the two highest fundamental
  frequencies, which is the inverse of the difference of the two
  frequencies.

** However, if the two highest fundamental frequencies differ by more
   than 100% (i.e. one fundamental frequency is at least twice as high
   as the other), then the time scale is set to display the longest
   wavelength of a fundamental frequency, i.e. one period of the
   lowest fundamental frequency.  Although there is theoretically an
   interference pattern among the waves, for all practical reasons, it
   is not perceptually discernible and the high frequency wave can
   just be considered to augment the low frequency wave.

Currently, it is not possible to manually set the time scale, and no
information is displayed about the automatically set time scale.

Once the time scale is set, the height of the waveform will be scaled
so that the sample of the waveform with the largest displacement will
just touch the top or the bottom of the display.  In technical terms,
this is automatic gain control.  In fact, for audio playback, the
amplitude scaling uses the same scaling factor that is used in the
display, which means if you have a really complex sound that cannot be
graphed accurately in the display, you will not be able to listen to
it either due to "clipping" of the audio output, which is when very
large amplitudes are cut off to the digital audio limits.

The Upper Toolbar
=================

The volume scaler in the user interface is applied in conjunction with
the automatic gain control corrector.  Generally, you always want the
volume scaler to be less than 1.00, so that if the automatic gain
control correction factor is slightly off, your sound output will not
get clipped.  Remember, the volume scaler only requests Slider to
attempt to adjust to a goal amplitude for automatic gain control.  The
hard maximum is determined by your sound hardware's volume settings.

The Control Area
================

The other main part of the user interface, the control area, is
devoted to editing a single grouping of a fundamental frequency and
its harmonics.  Multiple different sets of fundamental frequencies and
their harmonics can be mixed together to create the sound effect.
Separate fundamental frequencies must be edited separately.

The button labeled "Multiply Amplitudes" will change the current
maximum displacement (amplitude) to become the value that you type in.
Basically, it will calculate the height of the highest sample and
scale all component amplitudes so that the height of that sample will
become the value that you typed in.  If for some reason the number of
points that must be sampled exceeds 1000, you will be asked if you
still want to do the calculation.  On typical modern PCs with a CPU
that runs at a multi-gigahertz clock frequency, the calculation will
not run unbearably slow unless the number of points exceeds 100,000 or
so.

Recommended Workflow
********************

Slider does not support undo or redo.  When working on a project, you
are recommended to save lots of little files with small changes at a
time into a project folder, and then you can switch between your files
in any order whatsoever to further work on them.  When you have files
that you believe will no longer be of use to you, you would move them
into a "trash" folder that you created within your project folder, and
when you are really sure that you do not need those files anymore, you
would delete them for real.

You may notice that the files that Slider saves are just plain text
files.  This is intentional, of course, so that your data is not bound
to any special software.  However, there are limits to what Slider can
do with its project files.  In particular, when Slider loads its
project files, it completely ignores comments and thus cannot write
them back out on the next save.  Also, comments are only allowed in a
single continuous comment header at the absolute beginning of the
file.

Unusual or Missing Features
***************************

Originally, there were plans to add a command called "1st Harmonic
Drop."  It was never added due to a design misconception.
Conceptually, if you can add higher frequencies to the end of a
waveform, you should be able to add lower frequencies to the beginning
of a waveform from inside of an editor program.  The way this feature
would work would be to conceptually delete the current fundamental
frequency and make the second harmonic become the first harmonic.
However, that would cause some frequencies that were harmonics to no
longer be an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency and thus
become invalid, so this feature is currently disabled unless the other
understanding of it is implemented: add a lower frequency for which
the fundamental is a harmonic of.  Unfortunately, that also has a
disadvantage: the lower frequency is always half of the higher
frequency.

You may wonder why there are multiple redundant window management
buttons on the editor windows in the user interface, such as the
add/remove buttons for harmonic editor windows.  This is intended to
be a mechanism to insert the new window after the current one.  Right
now, you cannot click and drag windows to reorganize them, but you can
change which harmonic the windows are viewing to achieve a similar
task.

The combination of the mantissa editor, exponent editor, and multiple
scroll bars that are used to edit various numbers in the program are
called scientific number editors.  Because their implementation is not
yet complete, they have various hard-coded parameters which are not
yet configurable beyond modifying the source code.  These controls may
be improved in a later version of Slider Wave Editor.

Note that you can remove all harmonics of a given fundamental
frequency.  If you do, you will be unable to add then back using
conventional means.  You can of course delete the fundamental
frequency and recreate it to add harmonics back.

You will notice that when working with complex sounds, the display
window is noticeably deficient.  That is intentional for this version
of Slider, along with the unusual user interface. Improvements to
these deficiencies might be made in a later version.

Goodies and Enhancements
************************

As this program was not originally intended for other people to use,
its feature set may seem quite limited.  However, if that is how you
are thinking about this program, then perhaps you did not explore
enough of its features, and perhaps you did not think of how it could
be used in conjunction with other tools such as Audacity.  If you
select the "Export" action from the menu, then you can save a Nyquist
script that can be evaluated in Audacity to generate your waveform.
Then you can do further audio processing in Audacity.  Audacity's
website is <http://audacity.sourceforge.net>.  JACK
<http://jackaudio.org> can also facilitate transporting audio out of
Slider and into other audio applications.  JACK is the recommended
export mechanism for Slider.  The other, older export mechanism is
still provided for platforms where audio application integration with
JACK is either not as strong or non-trivial to set up.

Hopefully this program will help you experiment, analyze, and discover
various aspects of sound that you probably are not normally privileged
to access.
